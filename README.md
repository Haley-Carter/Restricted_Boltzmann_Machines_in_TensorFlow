In the notebook you will find an explanation of what is a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), how it works, and see an implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in TensorFlow. By the end of the notebook, you should be able to create simple Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and how to apply them to problems that involves unsupervised learning.
